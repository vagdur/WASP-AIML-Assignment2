# WASP-AIML, Assignment 2

The code in this repository not only does the tasks of the assignments, but it also runs a little website that contains all the explanatory text, and draws up interactive plots.

The overwhelmingly easiest way to "run" the code is to just click [this link to where it is running as a website](https://v-agdur.shinyapps.io/WASP-AIML-Assignment2/), but if you prefer running the code locally, running app.R with Rscript should kick off a server locally that lets you see the page in your browser, or you could open that file in RStudio and click the "Run app" button in the upper right corner of the file viewer.
